<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>This movie is so special to me because it is about a guy named Walter, who day dreams a lot because his life is so mundane. Then he goes on an adventure and the daydreaming gets less and less. The movie is about bravery and adventure, going into the unknown, which is the exact reason why I love it so much. It's like a life lesson.</p>
<h3>The Big Year</h3>
<p>This movie has similar concept as the movie above. Living life to the fullest and experiencing everything as you go. No regrets!</p>
<h3>I'll have to think about it for a bit</h3>
<p>I will get back to this once I know what my third favorite movie is.</p>
